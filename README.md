# plate_blur
## What it does
What this code does is it take in an image of a car with a license plate then blurs the plate so it becomes illegible

## How it works
I first detect the license plate then make that plate the region of interest. I then blur the ROI then replace the part of the image with the ROI with the ROI that is blurred.
